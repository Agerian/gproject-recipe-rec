Recipe and Drink Search App
Overview
Welcome to our Recipe and Drink Search App! This project was developed to provide users with a seamless experience in searching for recipes and drinks using two different APIs: Edamam and Api Ninja. Whether you're looking for a specific dish based on ingredients or a particular recipe type, our app has got you covered. Additionally, you can explore featured recipes and even save your favorites for future reference.

Features

Recipe Type Search: If you have a specific type of dish in mind, you can search for recipes based on categories such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert. The app leverages the Api Ninja API to provide a diverse range of recipes.

Drink Search: In addition to recipes, our app allows you to search for drinks. Explore a variety of beverages using the Api Ninja API.
